# AGENTS.md

Working instructions for AI coding agents (and new contributors) in this
repository. Read this file first, then [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md) for the
generated map of every document, tool and device schema.

## What this repository is

The reference implementation of the **LoRaWAN Payload Schema** language: a
declarative YAML/JSON format that describes how a device's binary uplink is laid
out, so one schema can produce decoders for many platforms.

It sits in the middle of three layers. Know which layer a change belongs to:

| Layer | Where | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| Specification | `la-payload-schema` (LoRa Alliance, companion to TS013) | The normative language definition and conformance requirements |
| **Reference implementation (this repo)** | `MultiTechSystems/device-payload-schema` | Interpreters (Python, JS, Java, Go, C, C#), generators, validators, device schemas |
| Consumers | e.g. `eclipse-thingweb/td-tools` | Pin this repo as a submodule and drive it |

Consequence: a language change is a specification change first. Do not add a
construct to the interpreter without a corresponding spec section, or the
implementations silently diverge from the normative text.

Note: `make validate` only covers `examples/*.yaml`. Device schemas under
`schemas/devices/` are not part of that target — validate and score those
explicitly.

## Quality tiers

`tools/score_schema.py` scores each schema out of 100 and assigns the tier
defined in the specification's Section 10: Platinum 95-100%, Gold 85-94%,
Silver 70-84%, Bronze 60-69%, **Rejected** below 60% ("insufficient coverage for
repository acceptance"). Most schemas in this repository are currently Rejected
because they ship no test vectors.

| Points | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 12 | Passes structural validation |
| 8 | Has usable `test_vectors` (payload *and* expected) |
| 20 | Python interpreter decodes all vectors correctly |
| 15 | Generated JS codec decodes all vectors correctly |
| 12 | All `match`/`flagged`/port branches entered by a vector |
| 8 | Edge cases covered (zero, max, negative, min payload) |
| 5 | At least 5 vectors |
| 20 | Correct IPSO + SenML + semantic annotation of detectable sensor fields |

Gold and Platinum additionally have **gates** (PS-239), not just points. A schema
missing any of these is capped below Gold however high it scores: at least 5
vectors, vectors passing, every branch covered, edge case vectors present, and no
incorrect annotations.

Three things to internalise before doing schema work:

1. A schema with no `test_vectors` cannot exceed Rejected, however correct it is.
2. The test gates total 80 points, so perfect vector coverage *alone* reaches
   only Silver. Platinum requires correct annotations too.
3. **A high score is not proof of correctness.** The tool runs a schema against
   its own vectors, so it measures self-consistency. Vectors generated from our
   own decoder score perfectly while encoding whatever bug they captured — this
   is not hypothetical, it is how a schema that mis-decoded every real payload
   held a 100% Platinum score. Declare `source:` on every vector
   (`vendor-doc`, `vendor-codec`, `field-capture`, `spec-example`, or
   `generated`) and run `--require-provenance` to make independent provenance a
   condition for Platinum.

```bash
python3 tools/score_schema.py schemas/devices --all --baseline score-baseline.json
python3 tools/score_schema.py <schema> --require-provenance

# Independent oracles. Use these before trusting a score.
python3 tools/crossvalidate_decentlab.py --vendor-dir ../decentlab-decoders
python3 tools/crossvalidate_ttn.py --devices-repo ../lorawan-devices \
    --vendor milesight-iot --schema-dir schemas/devices/milesight
```

The TTN device repository (`TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-devices`) carries, for most
vendors, both a declared set of input/output examples and the vendor's own
JavaScript decoder. Both are independent of this implementation, so they are the
right source for `test_vectors` on any of its 152 vendors — not our own output.

`score-baseline.json` is the committed baseline; CI fails on a *regression*
rather than on the backlog. Refresh it deliberately when scores legitimately
improve, and say so in the commit message.

Use the existing platinum schemas as templates: `decentlab/dl-5tm`,
`decentlab/dl-atm22`, `digital-matter/oyster`, `dragino/laq4`.

## Rules for this repository

**Test vectors must come from outside our own decoder.** A vector produced by
running our interpreter and recording what it printed proves nothing — it locks
in current behaviour, including bugs. Derive expected values from the vendor's
documentation or from the vendor's published TTN codec, and treat a disagreement
as a finding to investigate, not a number to overwrite. Regression vectors
generated from our own output are acceptable only when labelled as such.

**Do not hand-edit generated files.** `docs/INDEX.md` is generated by
`tools/generate_docs_index.py`; `generated/`, `output/` artifacts and generated
codec headers come from the tools. Change the generator, not its output.

**`tools/schema_interpreter.py` is a public API surface.** External consumers
(notably `td-tools`, which imports it by file path and calls
`SchemaInterpreter(schema).decode(payload, fPort=...)` and reads
`result.success` / `.errors` / `.data`) depend on its location and signatures.
Renaming or moving it breaks them silently — coordinate first.

**Every new or changed device schema** must validate, carry test vectors, and be
scored before commit. Record the tier you reached.

**Python style:** black with line length 88; tools must stay compatible with
Python 3.8 (`typing.List`, not `list[...]`; no `X | Y` annotations).

## Current gaps

Known weaknesses, so you neither trip over them nor assume they are intentional:

- **`schemas/payload-schema.json` is permissive.** `definitions.field` sets
  `additionalProperties: true`, declares no required keys, and types `type` as a
  bare string. It accepts an unknown wire type such as `s17`, a field with no
  `name`, and `mult: "0.1"`. For real structural checking use
  `tools/validate_schema.py`, which knows the type vocabulary.
- **Modifier order is now canonical everywhere — do not reintroduce key order.**
  Per CR-2026-002 (PS-101/PS-102), bare `mult`/`div`/`add` apply in the order
  *mult, div, add* regardless of how the keys were written, and `transform` is the
  only way to express another order. All implementations were brought onto this:
  Python, Go, Java, C#, the TS013 JS generator and the firmware C generator were
  applying source key order (or, in Go/Java/C#, three different orders depending
  on input format and code path); the C interpreter, its node/python/go FFI
  bindings, and the binary schema form were already canonical.
  `examples/canonical-modifier-order.yaml` is the cross-language fixture that pins
  this and is checked in CI — if you touch modifier handling in any language, that
  fixture must still decode identically. `validate_schema.py` warns when a field
  carries two or more bare modifiers, since the intent reads better as a
  `transform`.
- **Many published schemas are still unverified.** 62 of 158 device schemas ship
  with no test vectors and are therefore Rejected. See the per-device table in
  [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md). The decentlab and milesight families have been
  through a vendor cross-validation pass; the rest have not.
- **Milesight schemas are verified but unannotated.** 35 of the 84 still disagree
  with the vendor's own decoder, in two remaining ways worth knowing before picking
  one up: TLV channels that are never decoded at all, and fields where the vendor
  emits an array or object and we emit a scalar - the latter is a language gap, not
  a schema fix. Enum labels (ternary and status-map forms), the version and serial
  channels, and packed flag bytes are all done.
- **Flags packed into a byte need `consume: 1` on the last field.** An explicit bit
  range (`u8[4:4]`) never advances the read position by itself, so a channel of bit
  ranges consumes nothing and the TLV loop reads the value byte as the next tag.
  `ws50x` and three others failed to decode the vendor's own payload for this
  reason. One case remains unsolved: `em320-tilt` packs a flag into bit 0 of bytes
  already consumed by its angle fields, which no current construct expresses.
- **Some TTN declared examples are stale.** For `ws50x`, TTN's declared example
  says `switch_1: true` where the vendor's own decoder in the same repository says
  `"on"`. `crossvalidate_ttn.py` reports the two oracles separately for this
  reason; when they disagree, the vendor's decoder is the better authority. None of these schemas declare `unit:`, so they
  carry no semantic annotations and stop at Silver; the scorer's keyword heuristic
  would read milesight `battery` as IPSO 3316 voltage when it is a percentage, so
  units have to be established per device before annotating.
- **The JS TS013 generator has a shared-byte bug.** `generate_ts013_codec.py`
  can drop bare bit-range fields and fail to advance the cursor. The Python
  interpreter path is correct; only generated JavaScript is affected.
